# Contributing to UniPlateTracker

First off, thank you for considering contributing to UniPlateTracker! It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from fixing bugs and adding new features to improving documentation.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs
If you encounter a bug, please check the [existing issues](https://github.com/NotHGM/UniPlateTracker/issues) to see if it has already been reported. If not, please open a new issue using our "Bug Report" template. Providing detailed logs and steps to reproduce is incredibly helpful.

### Suggesting Enhancements
If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please open a new issue using our "Feature Request" template. This allows us to discuss the idea before you spend time on implementation.

### Submitting Changes (Pull Requests)
We use a `main` -> `develop` branching model.
- The `main` branch contains the latest stable release.
- The `develop` branch is where active development happens.

**CRITICAL: All Pull Requests must be opened against the `develop` branch.**

To submit a pull request:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch from `develop`: `git checkout -b feature/my-cool-feature develop`.
3. Make your changes and commit them with a clear, concise message.
4. Push your branch to your fork.
5. Open a Pull Request from your branch to the `NotHGM/UniPlateTracker:develop` branch.
6. Ensure the PR description clearly explains the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number (e.g., `Closes #123`).

We will review your PR as soon as possible. Thank you for your contribution!
